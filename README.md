## Features
- **Realistic Movement:** Simulates human-like mouse and character movements to avoid detection.
- **Failsafes:** Built-in protection mechanisms to stop the macro when anomalies are detected, keeping your account safe.
- **Customizable Settings:** Tailor the macro behavior to your personal fishing preferences.
- **Auto-detection:** Automatically recognizes when a fish is caught and recasts accordingly.
